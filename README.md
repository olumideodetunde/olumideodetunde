Short answer, I enjoy building impactful solutions with data.

I am Olumide, a Vet that moved into the data after seeing how much data impact decisions.

Over the last 3 year, I gradually built data skills and I am now on an "application" spree, so feel free to check my ML_end_to_end_Project repo to see what I am up to!

The idea is build data solutions to relatable challenges, then share the process and output. So follow me on [medium](https://medium.com/@olumideodetunde).

Feel free to suggest interesting challenges, you never know.

Stick around and see you around.
