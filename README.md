Hi there! 

Short answer, I enjoy building impactful solutions with data.

I am Olumide, a Vet that moved into the data after seeing how much data could impact decisions.

For the last 3 year, I have being building my data skills and now on an "application" spree, so feel free to check my ML_end_to_end_Project repo to see what I am up to!

The idea is build data solutions to relatable cases, then share the process and output with you guys. So follow me on [medium](https://medium.com/@olumideodetunde).

Feel free to reach out to suggest interesting challenges, you never know.

See you around.
