<h2>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</h2>
</div>

Hello, I enjoy building impactful data solutions that add business value. I am Olumide, a Vet who moved into the data after seeing how much data impact decisions.

Over the last few years, I have built data skills (and still building) and now on an "application" spree, so feel free to check my [ML_end_to_end_Project](https://github.com/olumideodetunde/ML_EndtoEnd_Projects) repo to see what I am up to!

My idea is to build data solutions to relatable challenges and share the process and output. Do  follow me on [medium](https://medium.com/@olumideodetunde). I also tell stories with data too, do follow on [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/olumide.odetunde/vizzes).

Please don't hesitate to suggest interesting challenges.
