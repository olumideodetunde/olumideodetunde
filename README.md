<h1>Data Scientist</h1>
<h2>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</h2>
</div>

I transitioned into data after reducing the annual production cycle by 42 days as a production lead.

Over the last 5 years, I have worked in the e-commerce, healthcare, and built environment sectors, delivering impactful solutions along the way.

Currently, I collaborate with underwriters to develop data solutions, enabling them to identify and write better risks in good time.

In my free time, I support a community of talents transitioning into the data space, alongside developing personal projects that deeply interest me.
