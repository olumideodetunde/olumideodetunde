Short answer, I enjoy building impactful solutions with data.

I am Olumide, a Vet who moved into the data after seeing how much data impact decisions.

Over the last 3 years, I have gradually built data skills (and still building). I am now on an "application" spree, so feel free to check my [ML_end_to_end_Project](https://github.com/olumideodetunde/ML_EndtoEnd_Projects) repo to see what I am up to!

My idea is to build data solutions to relatable challenges, and share the process and output. Do  follow me on [medium](https://medium.com/@olumideodetunde).

I tell stories with data too, do follow on [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/olumide.odetunde/vizzes).

Feel free to suggest interesting challenges, you never know.

Stick around and see you around.
